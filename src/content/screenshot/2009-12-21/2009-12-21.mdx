```
machine: Dell Studio 1555
OS: Windows 7
resolution: 1366x768
```

My previous laptop was getting old and I got a good deal on a new Dell machine.
I learned some lessons with this laptop.

At this point I was using Arch Linux so I did my homework, I checked the Arch
Wiki if this laptop is supported, it had a page and it said it is supported.
What I didn't realize was that AMD/ATi GPU's power saving feature was not
working on Linux. The machine did work but it was really hot and loud and the
battery run out in 30 minutes when running Linux.

I don't remember all the things I tried but finally I gave up and Installed
Windows 7. By this time I was using Linux for everything and using Windows
again felt backwards and I really wanted to keep using those tools. I converted
the Arch Linux partition into a virtual machine image and started experimenting.

I ended up with this weird thing, running a Windows native version of <W
page="X_Window_System" text="X server"/> and starting the Linux programs in the
virtual machine. This worked surprisingly well! I could keep using the Linux
terminal even GUI apps. I think this setup is similar in spirit to how <W
page="Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux#WSL_2" text="WSL2" /> works, that Microsoft
introduced 10 years after this. It was a fun setup, CPU performance was good
but it eat into memory. Even with the virtual machine running the laptop stayed
cool and had okay battery life.


Another lesson I learned was the resolution. I switched from a 4:3 ration to
one with 16:9 and to a smaller pixel count. 1366x768 was popular in laptops
around that time but after using this laptop I knew I will never get anything
this small again. If you remember how Windows 7 is supposed to look you may notice
that I made the windows titles and the taskbar heights smaller to gain a couple 
precious extra pixels.
