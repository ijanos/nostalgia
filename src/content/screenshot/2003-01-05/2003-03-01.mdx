# 2003-01-05

I was discovering Windows XP themes. Downloading random <W page="MSSTYLES"/>
files from the internet and patching a .dll to skip cheking the style file
signatures.

I was into [The Lord of the Rings](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/) *a
lot*. I think I had a wallpaper changer running in the background that rotated
wallpapers of the charaters.

Using <W page="Trillian_(software)" text="Trillian"/> to chat on multiple
networks. and Opera for browsing the web. Looks like I was setting up Apache
and PHP. I probably wanted to play with Wordpress or Drupal.

High taskbar with a custom quick launch bar appears again.
