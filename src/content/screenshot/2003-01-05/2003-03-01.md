# 2003-01-05

I was discovering Windows XP themes. Downloading random .msstyles files from
the internet and patching a .dll to skip cheking the style file signatures.

I was into The Lord of the Rings *a lot*. I think I had a wallpaper changer
running in the background that rotated wallpapers of the charaters.

Using Trillian for chats and Opera for browsing the web. Looks like I was
setting up Apache and PHP. I probably wanted to play with Wordpress or Drupal.

High taskbar with a custom quick launch bar appears again.
