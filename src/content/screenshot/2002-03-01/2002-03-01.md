# 2002-03-01?

I find it hard to beleive that in 2002 I was still rocking the screen
resolution of 800x600 pixels.

Picked the date from the file listing in the background. There is a directory
with this timestamp, so the screenshot cannot be younger than this.

I am trying to watch a copy of the Final Fantasy movie but I'm running into
issues with loading the subtitles. I remember fighting with codecs and
codec-pack, not having a real understanding about what they are or how they
work. They were magic dust that I had to install and Windows Media player
started playing the files.
