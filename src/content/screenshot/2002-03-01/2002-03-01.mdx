# 2002-03-01?

```
machine: Pentium II based desktop PC
OS: Windows 98
resolution: 800x600
```

I find it hard to believe that in 2002 I was using the screen resolution of
800x600 pixels. I have earlier screenshots with higher resolution.

Picked the date from the file listing in the background. There is a directory
with this timestamp, so the screenshot cannot be younger than this.

I am trying to watch a copy of the Final Fantasy movie but I'm running into
issues with loading the subtitles. I remember fighting with codecs and
codec-pack, not having a real understanding about what they are or how they
work. They were magic dust that I had to install and Windows Media player
started playing the files.

I was using Windows Commander for everything, I kept my most used program in
the toolbar. The **Q** and **T** icons are for <W page="QuickBASIC"/> and
<W page="Turbo_Pascal" text="Turbo Pascal"/>, the little turtle is
[ComeniusLogo](https://comlogo.hu/).
