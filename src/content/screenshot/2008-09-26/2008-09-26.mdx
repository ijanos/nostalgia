# 2008-09-26

I couldn't remember the program's name that created the slide-down terminal but
I remembered it used urxvt so I google "quake like urxvt" and in the first
result I stumbled into [a post of
mine](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=764749#p764749) from 14 years
ago that mentions the name of the program:
[yeahconsole](http://phrat.de/yeahtools.html). Thanks past-me.

The <W page="Neofetch"/>-like tool is a perl script that I probably downloaded 
from the  Arch Linux forums. Neofetch was released 7 years after this screenshot, 
but these kinds of script were popular before.
