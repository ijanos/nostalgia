Gyalogl√≥ was a large (largest?) web based chat in Hungary. I was hanging out
there almost every day when I was a high school student, from 6pm to 9pm
usually. The local dial-up pricing made connections after 6pm cheaper. I
haven't heard about IRC then.

When I wanted to chat with my friends I used an "instant messaging" program.
First ICQ and later MSN Messenger. Both programs become slow and large, when I
discoverd <W page="Trillian_(software)" text="Trillian"/> I happily switched.
It was a much faster small app without the bloat and it had the ability to chat
on multiple networks.

Internet Explorer dominated the market back then, 98% market share among
browsers. To be honest it wasn't bad back then, it did not feel slower or
bloated compared to other browsers in 2002. Later I discovered <W
page="Opera_(web_browser)" text="Opera"/> and never looked back on IE again.
