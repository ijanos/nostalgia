Gyalogl√≥ was large (largest?) web based chat in Hungary. I was hanging out
there almost all day when I was a high school student. I haven't heard about IRC
then, I think if I had I would have spent time there instead.

MSN Messenger was big and slow and I used Trillian to chat with friends on MSN
and ICQ.

Internet Explorer dominated the market back then, 98% market share among
browsers. To be honest it wasn't bad back then, it wasn't slower or bloated
compared to other browsers in 2002. Of course later I discovered Opera and
never looked back on IE again.
