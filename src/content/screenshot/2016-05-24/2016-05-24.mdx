Google Chrome's old look. I rember disliking when they changed away from it but
looking at it now it feels dated.


I wrote [a simple Chrome extension](https://github.com/ijanos/fulltube) that
forced a YouTube videos to take up the whole tab, a fake fullscreen mode,
obsoleted by YouTube's "Theater mode".
