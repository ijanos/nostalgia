# 2000

The earliest screenshot I could dig up.  Sadly, I cannot tell the exact day it was taken.

At the age of 13 I was learning English with the help of an offline dictonary.
The screenshot predates Google Translate by 6 years. No idea why I took a
screenshot of the word "frequent".

I do have vague memories of settings on the taskbar. I had this genius idea to
keep program shortcuts in the quick launch area of the taskbar, increase the
height and make the taskbar self-hiding. I don't think I keep that on for long.
