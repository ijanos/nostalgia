The earliest screenshot I could dig up. Sadly, I cannot tell the exact day it
was taken.

At the age of 13 I was learning English with the help of an offline dictionary.
The screenshot predates Google Translate by 6 years. No idea why I took a
screenshot of the word "frequent", I had probably no idea what it meant.

I had this genius idea to keep program shortcuts in the quick launch area of
the taskbar, increase the height and make the taskbar self-hiding. I don't
think I keep that on for long, it looks a bit stupid and I think I realized it.

I have MS Paint on the quick launch area, I'm pretty sure this image was saved
with MS Paint because I found it in bmp file format in an old CD.
