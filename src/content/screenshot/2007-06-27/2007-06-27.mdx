# 2007-06-27

```
OS: Ubuntu
Resolution: 1400x1050
machine: Acer TravelMate 6000 laptop

Around this time I was a full time Linux user. This is most likely Ubuntu.
I was using Gnome 2.x for a while then tried KDE and maybe even XFCE.
Sadly I couldn't find any screenshots of those. I didn't have too much
RAM at the time so I kept looking for thinner desktops, I landed on handrolling
my desktop with custom panels and openbox as window manager.

I loved using "quake like" terminals and browser tabs on the side.
