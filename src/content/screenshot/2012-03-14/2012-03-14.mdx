<W page="GNOME" text="Gnome" /> 3.0 was released about year ago, I've read
online that it polarizes people and I wanted to see whats it all about. I
installed it, started using it and it just clicked. To this day, 12 years
later, I am still using Gnome as my main desktop environment. I prefer it to
macOS, I prefer it to Windows. It works the way I think, I don't feel like I'm
fighting my computer when I'm using it.
