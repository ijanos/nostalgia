# 2005-04-14

```
OS: Windows XP
```

Windows XP with custom uxtheme titlebars and probably a custom looking taskbar
as well. Taskbar is on autohide and I had an instance of
[WinBar](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winbar/) for some basic system
information. Looks like the last release of WinBar was in 2013, someone in 2024
left a comment about subpar Windows 11 comptability.

The browser is <W page="Opera_(web_browser)" text="Opera" />, a beta version
even. At the time Opera was paid software and the free version had an ad banner
at the top. I somehow figured out how to blank that bar so it doesn't show ads.
I think at the time this was the only browser that allowed to put the tab bar
to the right side of the screen, which I really liked.

A note, that this Opera has nothing to do with the currently (as of 2025)
available Opera browser. They sold the rights to the name and the original
authors created <W page="Vivaldi_(web_browser)" text="Vivaldi" />.
