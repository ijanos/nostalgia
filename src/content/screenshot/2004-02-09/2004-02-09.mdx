I loved playing with alternative operating systems as a child. I had almost no
idea what I was doing. I had no access to the internet so I depended on free
CDs usually attached to computer magazines. I remember spending hours clicking
around in SuSE Linux, BeOS PE and probably others I've forgotten. It was a wild
west, they all felt magical. Something so strange and so useless.

[UHU Linux](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=uhu) was the first
that stuck. I never managed to switch to it fully, I loved playing games on
Windows and my sister was using the machine as well, forcing her to this weird
Linux thing was not an option but I kept it for dual booting.

UHU is long dead, their last release was in 2014. I never used it as my main
operating system, I was using Ubuntu when I first made the switch but I think
UHU is the reason I kept my interest in Linux. The UHU community was really
helpful, and in hindsight it must have been very small, they had a couple low
volume mailing lists where I could get help if I was stuck.

Not sure why I took a screenshot of the ATi Control Panel, my video card had a
TV out and I got my hands on a 5 meters long RCA cable and I really wanted to
connect my PC to my family's TV. I think I wanted to watch movies on it, but
the quality was never great, not to mention the trip hazard of the cable
runqning through the house. I think I had problems using the TV output from
Windows and I could make it work through Linux which blew my mind. Nowadays
HDMI is ubiquitous and connecting a PC to a TV is trivial.
