# 2004

This is a cropped screenshot I created to show off my personalized
<W page="Foobar2000" text="foobar2000"/>.

I was into metal music as a teenager and being a nerd meant I cannot just use
WinAmp anymore, I had to use foobar2k a customizable music player.

It is also supposed to have greater sound, which was wasted on me because by
the looks of it I was listening to 128kbps mp3 files.
