This is a funny one. It is still Windows 7 with Arch Linux in a virtual
machine, you can see the Start button peaking in the bottom left corner, but
instead of having all graphical Linux programs run in their own window I
switched X server to draw one large window and run my own window manager inside
it for Linux apps. Because I wanted to avoid managing windows inside a window
and getting confused I ran a <W page="Tiling_window_manager" text="tiling
window manager"/> called <W page="Xmonad" /> and relied on keyboard shortcuts
when I was working with Linux apps.

This felt better to work with than having a VNC/remote desktop into the VM.
